## FAQ

#### Can i use this project for Business and comercial uses?

Yes, you can, try to give the credits and make sure to fork this project, is gonna help me so much if you do (Also follow the MIT license policy).

#### You will maintain this project?

Of course, is a great idea and i want to make a great roadmap during this 2024 and the 2025, is gonna be a large project, but for now (1/1/2024) is a very small one.

#### Why Typescript over Javascript?

Well, javascript is a really good language and i know typescript sometimes is tricky with their types, but it cost me a very low quantity of bugs related to types and scopes if you use them properly, is a better javascript (a javascript with types) and with nodemon is very easy to make development

#### How to deploy it?

The project is on the initial phases and i am not a very experienced developer yet, but i want to make several branches in the future, my idea is to make a proper docker compose with the project and manage the nodejs and angular project using the static function in express server.
